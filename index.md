# About Me
## Current Research
  I am PhD candidate in Neuroscience at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, focused on constructing multimodal systems for generalized hypothesis generation and scientific discovery, with a specific interest and target of drug repositioning. 
  In order to achieve this, I use techniques from algebraic topology to create novel neural network architectures which are constructed to combine information from: scientific literature (text), genomic information (rna expression, dna methylation), and structure information (chemical structure embeddings that predict QM properties).

  My research interests include machine learning, meta-learning, neuroscience, topological data analysis, DNA methylation, aging, glioblastoma, nanotechnology, photophysics, and particle physics.

## Background
### Industry experience at Novartis
  During my PhD I had the pleasure of working with Novartis in their Global Drug Development Department on several projects that used non-linear mixed effects modeling for pharmacokinetics.
  Our group worked on applying these NLME models and improving the visualizations capabilities in many of the popular packages for NLME.
  See the main projects I worked on (xgx, xgxr, and the main tutorial website) [here](https://github.com/Novartis/xgx), [here](https://github.com/chasealanbrown/xgxr), and [here](http://opensource.nibr.com/xgx)

### Master's in Chemical and Biological Materials Engineering
  During my first graduate degree, I focused on the separation and characterization of nanomaterials, specifically in the context of biofuel catalysis.  Throughout these studies, my interest in modeling physical and biological phenomena increased, ultimately leading me to pursue a career in academia using the tools of ML and software development for solving problems in drug development with a focus on glioblastoma and aging.

I received a Master's in Chemical and Biological Materials Engineering from the University of Oklahoma in May of 2016. During this time, I conducted research under the supervision of Dr. Steven Crossley and Dr. Daniel Resasco. My work focused on synthesizing heterogenous catalytic supports, which involved combining magnetic nanoparticles with single-walled carbon nanotubes, for application in multiphase biofuel reactors.

### Industry experience at Southwest Nanotechnologies
  In the spring of 2014, I graduated with a B.S. in Chemical and Biological Materials Engineering and worked as the lead Research and Development Engineer at a Nanotechnology company developing, characterizing, and separating new materials for electronic applications.
