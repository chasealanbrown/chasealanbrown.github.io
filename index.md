### About Me
#### Current Research
  I am currently a student in the Neuroscience Ph.D program at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center. 
  As a member of the bioinformatics group led by Dr. Jonathan Wren, I construct novel artificial intelligence architectures for drug repositioning and discovery using scientific text and biological networks. 

  My research interests include machine learning, topological data analysis, DNA methylation, aging, glioblastoma, nanotechnology, photophysics, and particle physics.

#### Background
  Throughout my Master's in Chemical and Biological Materials Engineering on the separation and characterization of nanomaterials applied towards biofuel catalysis, my excitement towards modeling physical and biological phenomenon grew, leading my career path towards software development for modeling biological phenomenon in brain cancer.

  I received a Master's in Chemical and Biological Materials Engineering from the University of Oklahoma in May of 2016. During this time I worked with Dr. Steven Crossley (PI) and Dr. Daniel Resasco to synthesize heterogenous catalytic supports, consisting of magnetic nanoparticles and single-walled carbon nanotubes, for use in multiphase biofuel reactors.

  In the spring of 2014, I graduated with a B.S. in Chemical and Biological Materials Engineering and worked as the lead Research and Development Engineer at a Nanotechnology company developing, characterizing, and separating new materials for electronic applications.
